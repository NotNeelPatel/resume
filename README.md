# My Resume

This is my personal resume, inspired by different overleaf templates, written in LaTeX. I used this opportunity to also learn Vim and some of the keybinds.

## Why LaTeX?

Unlike word processors like MS Word, Google Docs, and their FOSS counterparts, LaTeX allows me to create documents with a lot of precision while also being a markup/scripting language. As this resume will be edited constantly throughout my career, it is important that I have a way to easily format and make changes to my resume without having the need to deal with GUIs that change. Using LaTeX also means that I won't need to worry about my resume being ATS-friendly (as much as some other programs).

## Future plans

I will eventually create some kind of cli or form that will autofill the resume contents, like a resume builder of some sort that will make my resume for me.
